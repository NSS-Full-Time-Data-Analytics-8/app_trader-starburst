Conclusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through our research, we found that for App Trader to make the most sound investment in a new app to follow a few different points of data to ensure the most success moving forward. One of our main points of emphasis were to include apps that have a high average rating throughout both the Apple store and Google play store due to the fact that apps which average higher rating will have a longer shelf life in the industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Our next data point that we wanted to focus on was the average review count. We chose to look at the review count over the install count because it shows that the app has a more engaged customer base and heavier traffic flow which will result in more in app-purchases and leading to a higher gross profit margin.                                                                                                                                                                                Finally, we wanted to look at titles that encompassed our first to points of emphasis and were also where the consumer had to purchase to apps to increase their profits on the front end. We have narrowed down our finding to a list of top 10 and out of those, if we were to give a top 3 then we would suggest Fruit Ninja, Hitman Sniper and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due their consistency in traffic, high average ratings immediate profitability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
